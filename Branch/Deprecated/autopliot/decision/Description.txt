The decision of e30 communicates with the datafusion of raeton for postureData, 
which emulates the positioning of vehicle (raeton) from roadside infrastructure (e30), 
calculates currentPoint and previewPoint,
send them to the datafusion of e30
and the datafusion of e30 send them in "IovE30" "Infrastructure" to Raeton for lateral control.
